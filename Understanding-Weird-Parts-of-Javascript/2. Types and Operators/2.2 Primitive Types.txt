Primitive types are anything whihc is not an object.
A type of data that represents a single value. 
remember objects are name and value pairs. 

There are 6 Primitive types in JS 

--------- 1. undefined --------------
undefined represents the lack of existence of a variable. it is a keyword that javascript sets when something
has been declared but not set to a value. We have seen this while learning the concept of hoisting. You shouldn't 
set a variable to this. Let this be for the engine.

---------2. null ----------------
This also means lack of existence of a value and you can use this. You can set a variable to null if you want it 
to be nothing explicitly

---------3. boolean -------------
It literally means true or false. both in lower case
