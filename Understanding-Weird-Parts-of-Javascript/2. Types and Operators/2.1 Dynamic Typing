Dynamic Typing is nothing but a big word which means, that You dont tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, it figures out itself while the code is running

variables can hold different types of values because all of that is figured out during execution

------STATIC TYPING---------
bool a = "hello" will give error

-----DYNAMIC TYPING---------
var a = true ;
a = 2.5
a = 'YAS QUEEN'
