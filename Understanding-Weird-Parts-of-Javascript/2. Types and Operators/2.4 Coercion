Coercion means converting a value from one type to other.
this happens a lot in js as it is dynamically typed

var a = 1 + '2' 
Note that 2 is a string and 1 is a number
so the out put of this is 12 as 
it coreced the number 1 to a string.

JS tends to try to convert it to what value you would want.
