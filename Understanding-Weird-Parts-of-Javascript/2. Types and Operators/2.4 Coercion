Coercion means converting a value from one type to other.
this happens a lot in js as it is dynamically typed

var a = 1 + '2' 
Note that 2 is a string and 1 is a number
so the out put of this is 12 as 
it coreced the number 1 to a string.

JS tends to try to convert it to what value you would want.

The coercion of Null to a number is 0 // we use it for not any value but it is coerced to 0
The coercion of '1' to a number is 1
the coercion of 'dsa' to a number is NaN which literally means not a number

Isn't this behaviour very strange?
