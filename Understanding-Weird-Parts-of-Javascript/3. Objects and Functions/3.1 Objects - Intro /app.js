// Objects are collection of names and value pairs. 
// That is an object .
// What can objects have inside them?
// Anything 
// objects have properties and methods.
// a primitive type (out of those 6) is called a property
// another object (this object I am talking about is inside a certain object). is also a property
// if objects have functions in them they are called as methods 
// So objects reside in the memory and they contain references to the properties and the methods which are also 
// present in the memory .
// Fair enough?
