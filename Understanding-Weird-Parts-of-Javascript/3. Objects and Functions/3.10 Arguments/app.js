// arguments and Spread.
// The later version of javascript has Spread.
// so we wont use arguments as much as we do .
// but lets talk about what arguments is.
// Remember?
// When you call a function the execution context is being set up and 
// javascript is giving you certain things,
// like the variable environment , the reference to the outer environment (the scope chain), the this keyword
// so whenever a function is being called javascript gives you one more variable.
// arguments
// what does this variable hold?
// it holds all the parameters you pass to the function while calling it.
// whatever we put inside those parantheses while calling the function are stored by the variable arguments
